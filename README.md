# UPDATE: Unfortunately, Google has removed this add-on from their marketplace.

Somehow a review was triggered again, and Google is requiring additional steps to re-publish the add-on.
Their review was a difficult process the first time I went through it, and I don't want to do it again.
I enjoy coding and was happy to provide this free add-on to the community. However, I don't wish to spend
time on needless bureaucracy.

Sorry, but for now the add-on is no longer available.

# GCalendar Sync

A Google Sheet add-on for synchronizing events with Google Calendar.
[See the website](http://www.ballardsoftwarefoundry.com/gcalendarsync.html) for full instructions. The add-on is
in the [G Suite Marketplace](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/gcalendar_sync/831559814916).

## Contributing

The project started as a simple script to publish swim team practice times on a Google Calendar
and has evolved from there. Fixes and improvements are done by volunteers, so please be patient.

You're also welcome to dive into the code and send suggested changes and fixes as a pull request
or as text. To try your own changes, you'll need to install Clasp in order to compile the Typescript
and push it to a project. Follow the instructions
[here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/typescript).

This will run the tests:

    $ npm test
